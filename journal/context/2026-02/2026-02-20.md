Completed PRD #8 Milestone 2: Go Lint Scoping in lint-changed.sh. Extended lint-changed.sh to handle Go files alongside JS/TS. For Go projects with golangci-lint: staged scope passes changed .go files directly, branch scope uses --new-from-rev for diff-scoped linting. Falls back to the full fallback command (e.g., go vet ./...) when golangci-lint unavailable. Mixed JS+Go projects lint both ecosystems independently. Created test-lint-changed.sh with 24 tests covering all paths. TDD approach: wrote failing tests first, then implemented to make them pass. No regressions in existing test-detect-project.sh (27 tests).
