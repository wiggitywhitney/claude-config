### Summary
The developer improved the markdown code block validation script to provide more informative error messages when multiple bare code blocks are found in a file. The script now counts the number of violations and generates a more detailed error message that explains how to address multiple code blocks in a single edit.

Specifically, the changes to the `check-markdown-codeblocks.py` script improved the error reporting by:
- Adding a count of bare code blocks found
- Pluralizing the error message based on the number of violations
- Providing explicit guidance to fix ALL code blocks in a single edit
- Clarifying that some code blocks may be pre-existing in the file

The motivation came from experiences with code block hooks in Anki skill specifications, where repeated edits were triggering multiple hook violations. The new approach aims to streamline the fixing process by giving clearer, more detailed instructions to the user about addressing multiple code block issues at once.

The developer was particularly concerned about maintaining clarity for future reference, ensuring that documentation and code blocks are properly labeled and easily understandable, even when introducing changes into existing codebases.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "I kind of think I wanted to check the whole file since it's being newly introduced into old code bases that do need this type of inspection. How does that change your recommendation? One idea is just to give a helpful error message to let the AI agent know what is going on if there are multiple code blocks that need fixing. What do you think?"
> **Assistant:** "You're right — checking the whole file is the right behavior. The problem is just that Claude fixes one, gets blocked, fixes another, gets blocked, repeat. The fix is in the error message: tell Claude to fix all of them at once."

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Improve Code Block Violation Error Message** (Implemented) - FILES: verify/scripts/check-markdown-codeblocks.py
  - Provide more informative error message when multiple bare code blocks exist
  - Count and display total number of bare code blocks in the file
  - Add guidance to fix ALL code blocks in a single edit
  - Clarify that pre-existing violations should also be addressed
