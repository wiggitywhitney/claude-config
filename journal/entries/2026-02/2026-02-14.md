### Summary
The developer updated the product requirements document (PRD) for shared testing infrastructure, adding two key decisions about verification hooks. Decision 10 introduces a tiered approach to git hooks, replacing a single full-verification commit hook with three targeted hooks: a quick+lint hook for commits, a full verification hook for pushes, and a pre-PR verification hook. Decision 11 clarifies that all hooks will run scripts directly without skill invocation, keeping the `/verify` skill for ad-hoc interactive use. The changes modify the Milestone 1 description and add detailed explanations for both decisions, refining the project's verification strategy.
