## 5:27:44 AM EST - Commit: c2d947d

### Summary
The developer created a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a `/write-docs` skill designed to generate validated documentation across different project types. The PRD outlines a structured approach to documentation that emphasizes executing commands to capture real output, writing docs chunk-by-chunk with user confirmation, and ensuring documentation accuracy through a structured validation process. Drawing inspiration from Vfarcic's dot-ai reference implementation, the PRD defines a project-agnostic skill that can work across multiple development environments, with clear principles for documentation creation, success criteria, and two key milestones for implementation and cross-project validation.

## 7:17:45 AM EST - Commit: 771ed88

### Summary
The developer implemented a detailed pre-commit hook script that prevents commit messages from containing AI or attribution references. The new script `check-commit-message.sh` and its accompanying test suite `test-check-commit-message.sh` create a solid mechanism to enforce clean, professional commit messages.

The hook is designed to extract commit messages across three different input formats (heredoc, -m, and --message) and block commits that include references to Claude, AI, Anthropic, or contain Co-Authored-By attributions. The implementation is careful to avoid false positives, such as matching AI references in file paths.

The test suite covers an extensive range of scenarios, including:
- Passing through non-commit commands
- Allowing clean commit messages
- Blocking various AI and attribution references (case-insensitive)
- Handling different commit message input formats
- Preventing false positives with file paths containing similar terms

This implementation addresses a specific workflow rule about maintaining professional commit messages and preventing AI attribution, with a deterministic and thorough approach to enforcement.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "That's funny I meant I want it to know that in case it needs to reference a rule. Look up how to reference rules"
> **Assistant:** "Good call. The `@` syntax resolves relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory — and you're already using it correctly in the Testing section with `@~/Documents/Repositories/claude-config/rules/testing-rules.md`."

> **Human:** "Okay, now what from that can be trimmed? probably \"Relative paths resolve relative
         + to the file containing the import, not the working directory. Use `@~/` for absolute home-directory paths a
         +cross projects.\""
> **Assistant:** "Agreed — that's the kind of detail the rule itself tells you to go look up rather than inline."

> **Human:** "I think it should always do a path-scoped rule file that's referenced from claude.md. No, it seems like a bad idea to give it a chance to say everything in claude.md. That might cause bloat. What do you think?"
> **Assistant:** "Agreed. Giving it the option means it'll pick the easier one — inline it in CLAUDE.md — every time. And that's exactly how CLAUDE.md files bloat. The whole point of Decision 19's path-scoped rules with `paths:` frontmatter is to keep CLAUDE.md lean."

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Implement Commit Message Hook to Block AI References** (Implemented) - FILES: verify/scripts/check-commit-message.sh, verify/tests/test-check-commit-message.sh

  - Block messages containing Claude, AI, Anthropic, or Co-Authored-By references
  - Handle heredoc, -m, and --message commit message formats
  - Extract only commit message text to avoid false positives from file paths
  - Provide deterministic enforcement for existing prompt-level rule in CLAUDE.md

**DECISION: Create Comprehensive Test Suite for Commit Message Hook** (Implemented) - FILES: verify/tests/test-check-commit-message.sh
  - Test non-commit commands for silent passthrough
  - Verify clean commit messages pass through
  - Check blocking of various AI reference patterns
  - Test message extraction in different formats (heredoc, -m, --message)
  - Validate false-positive resistance with file paths containing AI-related terms

## 9:27:27 AM EST - Commit: ba77804

### Summary
The developer added two new shell scripts for branch protection and code review enforcement hooks, along with detailed test suites to validate their behavior.

The commit introduced two key scripts in the `/verify/scripts/` directory: `check-branch-protection.sh` and `check-coderabbit-required.sh`. These scripts implement pre-commit and pre-merge hooks that can be selectively enabled or disabled via dotfiles (`.skip-branching` and `.skip-coderabbit`).

The `check-branch-protection.sh` script prevents direct commits to `main` or `master` branches, enforcing a workflow that requires feature branches. Developers can opt out by creating a `.skip-branching` file in the project root. The script uses detailed JSON-based output to communicate denial reasons and handles complex git command scenarios.

The `check-coderabbit-required.sh` script ensures pull requests receive a CodeRabbit review before merging. It checks for the presence of a CodeRabbit review via the GitHub API and can be disabled by creating a `.skip-coderabbit` file.

Accompanying these scripts are two detailed test suites (`test-check-branch-protection.sh` and `test-check-coderabbit-required.sh`) that rigorously test various scenarios, including:
- Passthrough of non-commit/non-merge commands
- Blocking commits to protected branches
- Handling of feature branch commits
- Opt-out mechanisms via dotfiles
- Edge cases like command chaining and different git/gh command formats

The implementation follows the project's Decision 16 for per-repository rule overrides and provides a flexible, deterministic approach to enforcing development workflow guidelines.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "I think /verify and /anki skills should live here and get symlinked to user so that I can use them in all repos, following the /prd-* pattern. What do you think?"

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Add Dotfile Override Hooks for Branch Protection and CodeRabbit Review** (Implemented)
  - Implement hooks to enforce branch protection and CodeRabbit review requirements
  - Allow per-repository opt-out via `.skip-branching` and `.skip-coderabbit` dotfiles
  - Align with global CLAUDE.md rules about branch and review practices
**DECISION: Comprehensive Test Coverage for New Hooks** (Implemented)
  - Create detailed test suites for both branch protection and CodeRabbit review hooks
  - Cover scenarios including non-commit commands, feature/main branch commits, dotfile opt-outs, and edge cases
  - Ensure 100% test coverage across different command variations

## 9:49:58 AM EST - Commit: 4ef2841

### Summary
The developer relocated the entire verify scripts and tests from the `verify/` directory to `.claude/skills/verify/`, and set up the appropriate symlinks. This refactoring follows a standard skills convention, which was likely established to organize Claude-specific tooling and hooks in a more structured manner.

The relocation involved moving multiple components:
- Bash scripts for various verification hooks and utilities
- Test scripts for those hooks
- A skill description markdown file
- Preserving the original directory structure and file permissions

The commit message confirms the intent: "refactor: relocate verify scripts to skills directory" with a clear explanation that this move follows the standard skills convention.

Specifically, files were moved from:
- `verify/SKILL.md` → `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`
- `verify/scripts/*` → `.claude/skills/verify/scripts/`
- `verify/tests/*` → `.claude/skills/verify/tests/`

Key scripts relocated include hooks for:
- Branch protection
- Commit message validation
- CodeRabbit PR review requirements
- Pre-commit, pre-push, and pre-PR verification
- Security checks
- Project detection and verification phases

The developer ensured that all functionality remained intact during the relocation, preserving the existing behavior of these development workflow tools.

### Summary
The developer added two new Claude Code skills to their project: an Anki card-making skill and a PRD (Product Requirements Document) closure skill. Both skills are detailed markdown-based tools designed to support specific workflow needs.

The Anki skill provides a detailed framework for creating structured flashcards, with extensive guidelines on card creation, formatting, and content styles. The PRD closure skill offers a structured approach to archiving and closing product requirement documents, including steps for updating metadata, moving files, and managing GitHub issues.

These additions represent important documentation and workflow automation for the developer's personal project management and learning processes.
