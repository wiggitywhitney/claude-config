### Summary
The developer fixed a Ruff linting error in the branch protection test file by resolving the git executable path at module load time instead of relying on a partial path string. They imported `shutil` and used `shutil.which("git")` to find the full path to git, then replaced all hardcoded `"git"` strings in subprocess calls throughout the test with a `GIT` constant. The change also includes a runtime check that raises an error if git isn't found on the system PATH. This affected 26 subprocess.run calls across the test file, converting them from using the bare string `"git"` to the resolved executable path.

### Summary
The developer added a noqa comment to suppress a Ruff linting rule (TRY003) on a RuntimeError that gets raised when git isn't found on the system PATH. The change was minimal—just a single-line comment addition to an existing test file—but it resolved a linting issue that was flagged during code review.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "yes fix it, then merge"

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Suppress Ruff TRY003 lint rule on RuntimeError guard clause** (Implemented) - FILES: .claude/skills/verify/tests/test_check_branch_protection.py
  - CodeRabbit re-review identified TRY003 as optional nitpick on inline RuntimeError string
  - Ruff lint rule triggered by exception raised with inline string literal
  - Added noqa comment to suppress the rule without refactoring the guard logic
